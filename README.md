Shoes Translator
================

This is a tiny Shoes app. It works as like as the Mouseover Dictionary.

Usage:
------
	cd shoes_translator/lib
	shoes shoes_translator.rb

- copy something
- select a language
- click `paste` link, then will be pasted from the system clipboard
- show the translation word as mouse hovering
- if not showing anything, click the word
- window is resizable
- re-select language at anytime
